In this file, by a selector we mean a keyword that can be used to
select which combination of simulator and model implementation will
be addressed by the script run_all_tests.

Example.  According to the table below, 

> run_all_tests hspice

would run the combination of a hspice simulator with the Verilog-A
model implementation as provided in the directory vacode.

Currently (June 2009) the following selectors are supported by this
version of the CMC QA toolkit:


Selector   | Simulator | Implementation | Remark
----------------------------------------------------
hspice     | hspice    | Verilog-A      | as in dir vacode
ads        | ads       | Verilog-A      | as in dir vacode
adsSiMKit  | ads       | SiMKit C-code  | see notes below




Notes:
======

adsSiMKit:

- For the selector adsSiMKit to work, the shell command
  `adssim' should invoke the SiMKit libraries.

- the selector 'adsSiMKit' at some stage invokes lib/adsSiMKit.pm
