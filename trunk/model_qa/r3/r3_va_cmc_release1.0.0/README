The files and directories here are for release 1.0.0 of the r3_cmc model.
Also included are the programs for running the QA tests provided with the
model for verification of implementation.

Summary of each file/directory and its contents:

results                    Directory with the simulated results for the QA tests for simulator/version/OS.


When running the QA tests for the r3_cmc model, some of the tests will report
results that DIFFER and will look to be "failing" but in fact are correct.
The specific tests affected are statTotal and statTotalMmOff for the "m" variant.
These tests include mismatch variations, and mismatch itself in the model varies
as 1/sqrt(m), hence the results do not exactly scale with m. The differences
reported should be similar to what is shown below.

****** Running test (mica): statTotal
     variant: standard            (compared to: reference) MATCH       (exact)
     variant: Flip_N              (compared to: standard ) MATCH       (exact)
     variant: noFlip_P            (compared to: standard ) MATCH       (exact)
     variant: Flip_P              (compared to: standard ) MATCH       (exact)
     variant: shrink              (compared to: standard ) MATCH       (exact)
     variant: scale               (compared to: standard ) MATCH       (exact)
     variant: m                   (compared to: standard ) DIFFER      (max rel error is 0.896%)

****** Running test (mica): statTotalMmOff
     variant: standard            (compared to: reference) MATCH       (exact)
     variant: Flip_N              (compared to: standard ) MATCH       (exact)
     variant: noFlip_P            (compared to: standard ) MATCH       (exact)
     variant: Flip_P              (compared to: standard ) MATCH       (exact)
     variant: shrink              (compared to: standard ) MATCH       (exact)
     variant: scale               (compared to: standard ) MATCH       (exact)
     variant: m                   (compared to: standard ) DIFFER      (max rel error is 0.984%)
